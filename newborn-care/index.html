                            <h1>Newborn Care Options: Home Visits, Text Contact, and More</h1>
                            <p>
                            Bringing a new baby home is exciting, emotional, and often overwhelming. Between feeding questions, sleep
                            deprivation, and postpartum recovery, the last thing most parents want is to load a newborn into a car seat and
                            sit in a waiting room.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            At <strong>Direct Care Pediatrics (DCP)</strong>, we offer flexible, relationship-based newborn care options
                            designed to support families during those important first weeks — including newborn house calls in the comfort of
                            your own home.
                            </p>

                            <h2>Personalized Newborn Care — Built Around Your Family</h2>
                            <p>Newborns don’t follow a schedule, and neither should their care.</p>
                            <p>
                            Unlike traditional pediatric clinics, Direct Care Pediatrics uses a direct primary care model, which allows for
                            longer visits, direct communication with your pediatrician, and flexible visit options based on your family’s
                            needs.
                            </p>

                            <p>Our newborn care focuses on:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Time and education (not rushing through checklists)</li>
                                <li>Conservative, evidence-based guidance</li>
                                <li>Supporting parents, not overwhelming them</li>
                                <li>Reducing unnecessary stress</li>
                            </ul>
                        </section>

                        <section>
                            <h2>Option 1: In-Home Newborn Visits (House Calls)</h2>
                            <p>
                            One of our most popular newborn care options is in-home newborn appointments. Instead of packing up your baby and
                            driving to a clinic, <strong>Dr. Dallin Hubbard, MD, PhD</strong>, comes to you.
                            </p>

                            <p>Why parents choose newborn house calls:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>No exposure to sick kids in waiting rooms</li>
                                <li>Baby stays calm and comfortable</li>
                                <li>Parents can ask questions in a relaxed setting</li>
                                <li>Ideal after C-sections or complicated deliveries</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>
                            Many families choose a house call for their first pediatric visit after birth, as well as early weight checks or
                            feeding concerns.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            Home visits are especially helpful during the first 1–2 weeks, when parents often have the most questions and
                            when babies are most vulnerable to germs from other kids.
                            </p>
                        </section>

                        <section>
                            <h2>Option 2: Office Visits With Longer Appointment Times</h2>
                            <p>
                            For families who prefer coming into the office, DCP also offers unrushed newborn visits in our
                            <strong>Sandy, Utah</strong> clinic.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            Typical pediatric offices schedule newborn visits in 10–15 minute blocks. At Direct Care Pediatrics, visits are
                            usually <strong>30–60 minutes</strong>, allowing time to talk through:
                            </p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Feeding and weight gain</li>
                                <li>Sleep and normal newborn behavior</li>
                                <li>Umbilical cord and skin questions</li>
                                <li>Developmental expectations</li>
                                <li>Parental concerns and reassurance</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>
                            Our clinic visits are by appointment only, which also limits exposure to disease in waiting areas and around
                            other children.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            Our goal is to make clinic visits feel as comfortable, safe, and personal as home visits. You’ll never be pushed
                            out the door, and we’re always here to listen.
                            </p>

                        <section>
                            <h2>Option 3: Direct Text Access for Newborn Questions</h2>
                            <p>Newborns don’t wait until business hours to have questions.</p>
                            <p>
                            At DCP, parents have the option to text their pediatrician directly, which is especially valuable during the
                            newborn stage.
                            </p>

                            <p>Families use text access for questions like:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>“Is this normal newborn breathing?”</li>
                                <li>“Should I be worried about this rash?”</li>
                                <li>“How often should my baby be feeding?”</li>
                                <li>“Does this stool color look okay?”</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>
                            Many concerns can be handled with reassurance or guidance over text — saving families unnecessary urgent care or
                            ER visits.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            If you’re interested in trying this option, send us a text at
                            <a href="tel:+13854626880">385-462-6880</a>.

                        <section>
                            <h2>Flexible Membership and Visit Options</h2>
                            <p>We understand that every family’s situation is different. That’s why DCP offers multiple ways to access newborn care:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Full membership (includes visits and direct access)</li>

                                <li>One-time visits, including newborn house calls</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>This flexibility works well for:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>First-time parents</li>
